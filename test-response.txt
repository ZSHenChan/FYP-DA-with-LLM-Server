Short summary of what the data already suggests
- There is an average negative association between gold price and traded volume: higher volumes tend to occur with lower prices.  
- The relationship is weak and unstable: scatter points are widely spread with clusters and outliers, residuals from a simple linear fit show curvature and changing spread, and residuals have heavy tails.  
- Time structure matters: price trends upward while volume tends downward with spikes. The price–volume link appears to change over time (nonstationarity / regime changes).

Key caution
- Don’t trust a single simple OLS fit for inference or causal claims. The OLS assumptions are violated (nonlinearity, heteroscedasticity, non-normal errors, and time dependence), so p-values and confidence intervals from naive OLS are unreliable.

Practical, prioritized plan you can run next
1) Data cleaning and quick fixes (high priority)
   - Inspect and flag extreme spikes in volume and zero-volume periods (are zeros missing data or real?). Decide whether to remove, impute, or keep and model separately.  
   - Consider aggregating to weekly or monthly if the high-frequency noise isn’t relevant to your question.

2) Exploratory data analysis (high priority)
   - Plot price and volume time series together, and create a scatter Price vs Volume colored by time (or faceted by subperiod).  
   - Compute Pearson and Spearman correlations overall and in rolling windows (e.g., 90-day) to see how the relationship evolves.  
   - Look at distribution summaries (median, IQR) and histograms for both series.

3) Transformations and simple fixes (high priority)
   - Try log(volume + 1). Consider log(price) if appropriate. These often stabilize variance and reduce skew.  
   - Winsorize or trim extreme volume spikes for sensitivity checks, but also run robust methods (next step) instead of only deleting data.

4) Baseline modeling and diagnostics (high priority)
   - Fit an OLS baseline (price ~ volume) to get a first look, but critically run diagnostics: residuals vs fitted, Q–Q, Breusch-Pagan test for heteroscedasticity, and influence measures (Cook’s D).  
   - If heteroscedasticity is present, report heteroscedasticity-consistent (White) standard errors or use weighted least squares.

5) Robust and nonlinear modeling (medium priority)
   - Robust regression (Huber, RANSAC) or quantile regression (median regression) to reduce outlier influence.  
   - Nonlinear approaches: add polynomial terms, splines, or use a GAM to capture curvature without overfitting.  
   - If interpretability less important, use tree-based models (random forest, gradient boosting) to capture complex patterns — but validate time dependency and avoid lookahead.

6) Time-series specific analyses (medium–high priority if time dependence matters)
   - Test stationarity (ADF) for both series. If nonstationary, difference or detrend before regression or use cointegration tests.  
   - Test for Granger causality: does past volume help predict price (and vice versa)? If both series interact, consider VAR models.  
   - If interested in volatility dynamics (price volatility vs volume spikes), consider GARCH-type models or regressions on realized volatility.

7) Rolling / regime analysis (medium priority)
   - Compute rolling correlations and rolling regressions to show whether the sign/strength is stable or regime-dependent.  
   - Consider regime-switching models (e.g., Markov switching) if there are clear structural periods.

What to report / metrics to show
- Correlation measures (Pearson and Spearman), with rolling-window plots.  
- Baseline model fit (R-squared, adj. R-squared) but also RMSE and MAE as predictive metrics.  
- Robust model estimates (e.g., quantile regression median slope) and comparison to OLS.  
- Diagnostic plots (residuals vs fitted, QQ), Breusch-Pagan p-value, and influence measures.  
- If time-series models used: ADF p-values, Granger causality p-values, and VAR impulse-response summaries or cointegration test results.

Interpretation guidance (how to phrase conclusions)
- A negative association on average: report magnitude e.g., “X% change in volume associated with Y unit change in price” under your chosen transform — but label it association, not causation.  
- Emphasize instability: show rolling correlation or subperiod regressions and say “relationship varies over time / driven by spikes/outliers.”  
- If causal claims are needed, state additional requirements: exogenous shocks, instrumental variables, or natural experiments.

Quick checklist of tests/plots to run now
- Time series plots of price and volume.  
- Scatter Price vs Volume colored by date.  
- Histograms and log-transform checks.  
- Pearson and Spearman correlations (overall + rolling).  
- OLS regression with White SE and residual diagnostics.  
- Breusch-Pagan test.  
- Robust regression (Huber or quantile).  
- ADF test for stationarity and Granger causality.

If you want, I can:
- Draft the specific sequence of code (pandas + statsmodels + sklearn) to run these steps, or  
- Walk through interpretation of your current model output (coefficients, diagnostics) if you paste them here, or  
- Prepare a short analysis plan and figure list you can hand off.
