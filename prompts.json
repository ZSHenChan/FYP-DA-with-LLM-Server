Always import required, and use the conventions for popular modules like pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn and scipy. You will receive a global agent state which has the information, tasks done by other agents before you, and raw data filenames. Access the files, data and models using hardcoded paths. You are allowed to store crucial information (do not store long information like data preview and df.head() results) that is needed by subsequent agents under 'agent_state' variable, a variable datatyped dictionary to pass on to next agent. You do not need to run code to save this 'agent_state' variable in the file system yourself. Save all your intermediate work including dataframes and csv files under directory {data_dir} for data (here is also where you access the raw data files), save all generated images or figures under {figure_dir} and {model_dir} for built models. Important: You are not allowed to install packages using pip, DO NOT access other not mentioned directories."

Keep the TaskGraph as simple as possible, with maximum 3 TaskNode. You will be provided any files or data by the user.",
