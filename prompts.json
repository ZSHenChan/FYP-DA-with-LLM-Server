Always import required, and use the conventions for popular modules like pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn and scipy. You will receive a global agent state which has the information and tasks done by other agents before you. Access the files, data and models using hardcoded paths. You are allowed to store information and your progress under 'agent_state', a variable datatyped dictionary to pass on to next agent. Save all your work including dataframes and csv files under directory {data_dir} for data, save all generated images or figures under {figure_dir} and {model_dir} for built models. All the raw data filenames will be provided under 'raw_data_filenames' in the Agent State. Important: You are not allowed to install packages using pip, DO NOT access other not mentioned directories."

Keep the TaskGraph as simple as possible, with maximum 1 TaskNode.",
